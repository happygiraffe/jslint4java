Updating JSLint
===============

In order to update to the latest version of JSLint, you need to run a few
commands, which will do most of the work.  You will need the following tools
installed:

* Ruby
* Curl

This will bring in the latest version directly from jslint.com, then update
the Option.java file accordingly.

  $ cd …/jslint4java
  $ jslint4java/etc/update-jslint.sh
  Please update jslint4java-docs now!
  $ mvn test

If you have a version already lying around, you can specify it as a command
line parameter to update-jslint.sh.

Assuming all the tests pass, you should then update the documentation.  If
any new options have been added, they should be mentioned in:

* NEWS.txt — mention the version bump
* jslint4java-docs/src/main/resources/ant.html
* jslint4java-docs/src/main/resources/cli.html

Finally, commit all changes.
